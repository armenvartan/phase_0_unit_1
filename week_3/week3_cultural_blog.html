    During my pairing with Emmanuel, I felt very thankful for his help. It was really nice to
    have someone pick up the slack where I was having problems figuring things out. I would not
    have been able to code that specific challenge in that time frame at that time without his
    input. I learned a lot from the experience. I hope to be able to do that for others. I
    remind myself a lot that the goal is growth not 'winning' at an assignment.

    <ul>
      <li>
        Kind feedback: Be nice. Regardless of what you have to say, you don't have to be mean about it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Actionable: Make it something that can be implimented. It's very helpful to have concrete
        steps to take when trying to improve yourself. Actionable feedback should give you something
        that is clear what you can do to work on it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Specific: Rather than giving a family of kind, actionable things as feedback. Focusing on
        one or a few things allows you to pick something that you can 'specifically' work on the
        next time. No need to fix the world right away.
      </li>
    </ul>

      It was fun to pair with other people. Both had good ideas, and it was fun not working alone.

    <li>
      I haven't received feedback yet.

      It was interesting. I didn't get perfect scores on my feedback, and that hurt at first. I
      want to be able to communicate better, so whatever.
    </li>

      It depends on the person. When giving feedback, there's no point in just being nice. It's an
      opportunity to improve, and no one is perfect. Making sure that I don't say something that
      will be perceived as hurtful can be difficult, but, also, I can't really control how someone
      takes something.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I pairing and feedback are good things. Regardless of our future work situations, we will be working
    with people (either as customers or coworkers). I see this as a good opportunity to work on working
    with people.
