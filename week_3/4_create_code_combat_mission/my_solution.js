// I worked [with: Katie Reiner, Timoor Kurdi] on this challenge
// I'm posting the code that I did with Katie on this challenge.
// Timoor and I worked out the skeleton of the other project together.
// Your mission description:

// There is a big ogre in front of the exit.
// Recruit some help to take it down.

// Pseudocode

// Friendlies: Archer
// Enemies: Ogre
// Objective 1: Free archer
// Objective 2: Kill Ogre
// Map: http://flockdraw.com/gallery/view/1872977
// Commands: moveXY(), say(), openDoor(), tipToeXY(), attack()

// Initial Code

this.moveXY(4,5);
this.attack();
this.moveXY(2, 5);
this.openDoor();
this.say("Follow me");
this.tipToeXY(7,3);
this.openDoor();
this.tiptoeXY(1,1);
this.say("Attack!");
this.attack();
this.moveXY(7,0);
this.openDoor();





// Refactored Code
// We mapped out the problem on a community whiteboard website.
// This made doing the code for the level very easy.
// I don't see any refactoring for the problem.





// Reflection
// We mapped out the level and decided on the objectives before coding anything.
// This made the execution of the level very easy. It was fun making up a level.
// I found a whiteboard page that works like Stypi, except for drawing. That made
// designing the level, and seeing and troubleshooting what we were thinking very easy.
// Since I was working with people, I treated this challenge as an opportunity to work
// on my communication skills and working out a problem before diving into it. This is
// very similar to how I approached math proofs, so it was fun to revisit that problem
// solving technique. I'm working on using coding words for these concepts. These
// techniques are not unique to coding (they work for problem solving in general), but
// I want to make sure that I can communicate properly with programmers, not mathematicians
// or construction workers--so I need to use the same language that this community uses.
