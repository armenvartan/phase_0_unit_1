# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0?  
Knowing how long things will take, and telling people no.
* How will you combat that?  
The first will come with more experience coding. I will understand how long something should take when I actually know what it is, and can plan appropriately. On the saying no part, I need to say no more and make sure that I make time for myself, regardless of what's happening around me. I’ve found some places lately where I can work, not be bothered, and not be home (I’m currently not too good at working at home).
* What techniques will you try?  
Meditation. Having a better self awareness should help keep me from getting caught up in what’s going on around me. I get excited easily.
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?  
Learn as much as possible. I'm not narrowing down my plan until I know more about coding and the program itself. Right now any knowledge feels like good knowledge. Part 2 of the plan is to prepare my body for it. Sitting for the hours that I will be, if my body isn't in decent shape before starting, I'm only going to have more back pain and trouble sleeping. Those kinds of things have worn me down before and kept me from performing as well as I can. I started unlimited yoga last week and plan to go 5-6 times a week until I move to NYC.
